## Requirements

* Mbstring PHP Extension.
* Either the [ImageMagik](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php) or [GD](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php) library installed and enabled on your server (not really required, but needed to create thumbnails).


## Installation

### Automatic installation ###

1. Log in into your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New.
3. In the "Search Plugins" field, type in **Recently** and hit Enter.
4. Find the plugin in the search results list and click on the "Install Now" button.

### Manual installation ###

1. [Download the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recently/) and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `recently` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate **Recently** through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

### Done! What's next? ###

1. In your admin console, go to Appearance > Widgets, drag the Recently widget to your sidebar and click on Save.
2. If you have a caching plugin installed on your site you may need to adjust some settings to make sure Recently can work: [Is Recently compatible with caching plugins?](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/3.-FAQ#can-recently-work-with-caching-plugins-such-as-wp-super-cache) Also, if you're using a JS minifying plugin you may need to add recently.min.js to its exclusion list (see [Is Recently compatible with plugins that minify / bundle JavaScript code?](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/3.-FAQ#is-recently-compatible-with-plugins-that-minify--bundle-javascript-code))
