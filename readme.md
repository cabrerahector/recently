## Description

Recently is a highly customizable [widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/recently/) to showcase the most recent entries from your [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) powered site.


## Features

* **Multi-widget capable**. That is, you can have several Recently widgets on your blog - each with its own settings!
* **WPML support**.
* **WordPress Multisite support**.
* **WordPress Popular Posts support** - Display the views count of your recent posts!
* **Custom Post-type support**. Wanna show other stuff than just posts and pages?
* Display a **thumbnail** of your recent posts! (see [technical requirements](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/5.-FAQ#im-unable-to-activate-the-display-post-thumbnail-option-why)).
* Use **your own layout**! [Control how your recent posts are shown on your theme](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-can-i-use-my-own-html-markup-with-your-plugin).
* **Shortcode support** - use the `[wpp]` shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! (see "[Using WPP on posts & pages](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages)").
* **Localizable** to your own language (See [here](https://github.com/cabrerahector/recently/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-translate-your-plugin-into-my-language--help-you-update-a-translation-what-do-i-need-to-do) for more info).

## Requirements

* WordPress 3.8 or above.
* PHP 5.2+ or above.
* Either the [ImageMagik](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php) or [GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php) library installed and enabled on your server (not really required, but needed to create thumbnails).
